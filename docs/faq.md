## What should I do if the AI gives strange or incorrect answers?

First, check your prompt: was it clear and specific enough? Try rephrasing your question. Sometimes it helps to start a new conversation or select a different AI model.

## What's the difference between "Custom Instructions" and a "Persona"?

"Custom Instructions" are general directions you give the AI for all your conversations (unless a persona is active), like "Always answer in Dutch" or "Use a formal tone." A "Persona" is much more specific - you give the AI a complete role (for example, "critical researcher" or "creative copywriter") for a certain task or conversation. An active persona overrides your custom instructions.

## What about privacy when I upload documents?

Any information you enter UvA AI Chat falls under the same security and privacy policies as your UvA emails and documents. It's not accessible to external parties and is not used for training AI. Of course, always use caution when uploading documents containing personal data of others, confidential business information, or other sensitive material. For more information, please consult our policy framework and guidelines on GenAI in education.

## The AI doesn't seem to fully understand my long conversations or documents. Why is that?

This probably relates to the "context window." The AI can only "remember" a limited amount of text at a time. So, if you have a very long conversation or upload many documents, the AI may not be able to process all of it. If your conversation gets long, start a new chat (you can summarize the original chat and bring that summary with you). If your document is long, try asking specific questions about sections of it, summarize it yourself first, or break it up and let the AI summarize each part. You can also try selecting a model with a larger context window if one is available.

## Why is the UvA developing its own AI infrastructure?

With UvA AI Chat, the University of Amsterdam offers a safe and responsible alternative to commercial generative AI (GenAI) tools. Developing its own AI infrastructure allows the UvA to:

- Maintain control over data (digital sovereignty);
- Safeguard privacy;
- Ensure equal access for staff and students;
- Support academic freedom;
- Provide transparency about the impact of the AI models used;
- Contribute to the conscious and responsible use of GenAI in education;
- Follow the leading core principles of the Dutch Code of Conduct on scientific integrity.

## How is it different from ChatGPT, for example?

UvA AI Chat is similar to ChatGPT but is managed in-house and specifically developed for and by the UvA. This means all input remains under UvA control, making the university less dependent on big tech as an educational and research institution, and allowing the tool to be tailored to its specific needs.

A key feature is UvA's own front-end user interface, which provides control over how students, lecturers, and researchers interact with AI models. Through the implementation of an intermediary layer, UvA AI Chat is independent of any specific Large Language Model (LLM). The infrastructure supports various models, giving flexibility to choose the most appropriate one.

## Who developed UvA AI Chat?

UvA AI Chat was developed by a multidisciplinary project team with colleagues from all faculties and services, as part of the project "Navigating the Ocean of Artificial Intelligence" (abbreviated as NOKI).

---

## How does UvA AI Chat handle data and data protection?

All input is managed by the UvA. This means both input and output are protected, and the application can be used securely. Input from UvA AI Chat is not used to train or improve language models, so no model training takes place.

As an individual user, you can delete your chat history. Once deleted, your chat history cannot be restored.

## Are there examples of successful UvA AI Chat implementations?

Yes, several pilot projects have been conducted using UvA AI Chat. You can learn more about these pilots through the UvA Teaching & Learning Centres. Check out a few of them here.
