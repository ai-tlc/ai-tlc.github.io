## About this manual

This manual for UvA AI Chat is designed as a reference guide where you can look up information about the various features and settings of UvA AI Chat. If you're using UvA AI Chat for the first time - or if you don't have much experience with generative AI - we recommend starting with the "Getting Started with the UvA AI Chat" e-learning. This e-learning module walks you through all the basic features step by step and shows examples of how you can use the tool. Once you're familiar with UvA AI Chat, you can use this manual as a reference whenever you need it. You can also use the "UvA AI Chat Ondersteuning" persona within UvA AI Chat, which is based on this guide.

Because AI is evolving rapidly, this manual will also be regularly updated. The latest features and applications of UvA AI Chat will be included in future versions.

## 1.1 Responsible use

It's essential to understand that UvA AI Chat, like any other AI tool, is not infallible. The model can present mistakes, inaccuracies, biases, or incorrect information as if it were fact. Never rely blindly on the generated output. Always verify the results carefully and apply critical judgement each time you use it. Also keep in mind that using AI consumes both energy and water.

### Practical example of responsible use

Suppose you ask the AI to summarize a scientific article you've uploaded. The AI produces a concise summary.

* **Irresponsible use:** You copy the summary directly and use it in your own work without any verification.
* **Responsible use:** You read the summary generated by the AI and compare it carefully to the original article. You check whether the main arguments, methodology, and conclusions are represented correctly. You use the AI output as a tool to help you grasp the article faster, but you base your own work on the actual source text.

Part of using generative AI responsibly is being aware of the possible downsides. When using AI, you should be aware of the risks of cognitive offloading. Cognitive offloading refers to the process of transferring cognitive processes to an external tool, such as an AI. Especially in an educational setting it is important to be aware that continuous reliance on AI for a particular task might hinder you from developing knowledge and skills that would benefit you in the long run. Research shows that using AI frequently but unreflectively can lessen critical thinking abilities.

To use AI effectively and responsibly, we need to develop our AI literacy. Among other things, this means understanding how to use AI tools well, like asking the right questions, and carefully checking what the AI produces. By developing our AI literacy we can ensure that we make use of AI in such a way that it supports our work, learning, and research in a valuable manner, while mitigating the risks the use of AI poses.

## 1.2 Your first step: logging in

Open AI Chat in your webbrowser. Enter your UvA login details - this means your email address and password linked to your UvA account. For additional security, two-factor authentication (2FA) is required; you'll need to enter a verification code sent to your mobile device. After successful authentication, you'll have access to the UvA AI Chat dashboard and can use all its features.
